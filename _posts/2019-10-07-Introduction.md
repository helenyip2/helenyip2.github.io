title: Introduction to myself
---

Hi everyone! My name is Helen and I'm continually learning about data science and life.

My hobbies include:

- Eating food, preferably snacks and meat. (Steak is best!)
- Reading books including fiction and graphic novel. I sometimes throw in some non-fiction into the mix as well.
- Going to museums and art galleries. It's ridiculous how close I can get to something that's worth so much money!
- Meeting and petting dogs. I love all of them eventhough I'm allergic.

Posts on here will be a combination of concepts I want to learn more, thus making a post about it, and probably some random stuff to the mix.

I'm hoping to to be better at the following from writing and putting together these posts:

- explaining concepts
- writing in markdown

**Coming up:** Difference between Python string methods that outputs booleans compared with the same ones in Pandas. <br>
It's going to be riveting! Stay tuned!
