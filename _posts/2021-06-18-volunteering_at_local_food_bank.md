When I was in high school, I volunteered at a food bank one time. I enjoyed it and it was one of the experiences that stayed in the back of my mind. (The one at the soup kitchen was a different story.)


I haven't gone out much this year, given the pandemic. I was getting emails from the local food bank wanting monetary donations. The demand for their emergency hampers had doubled since the pandemic started. I wasn't able to donate much monetary wise as I'm unemployed at the moment. I decided I would donate my time instead. After I got my first covid vaccine, I decided to contact the food bank to sign up as a volunteer.


I'm currently signed up to help with sorting food donations and preparing emergency hampers. The volunteers for each shift are split into 2 different groups. One group packs emergency food hamper boxes to hand out to people. These hampers include food to last someone 1-2 days.Â  They include some sort of non-perishable veggie, carbohydrates, and meats.


The other group of volunteers are sorting the donated food donations. I am usually in this group. The donations come from individuals, community food drives, and from grocery stores. There are items that people have donated that are a couple years past the best before date. The oldest one I found had a best before date in 2010.


Baby food and baby related items are not handed out if it's past its best before date. For all other food donations, they are still considered good if the best before date is up to a year ago. This is the standard at the local food bank I'm currently volunteering at.


I've only been volunteering at the food bank for a month, but I love it. It is a lot of heavy lifting. It's nice to work together as a team with people to get a task done. The people I'm currently volunteering with range from high school students to retirees. I'm going to keep volunteering until I find a new job. I'll definitely see if there's an evening shift available to see if I can volunteer when I start a new job.


If you are ever donating items for food banks, here's what to consider:

- Super expired items get thrown out during sorting.
- Opened food items get thrown out even if it's not expired.
- Items without a best before date including the year gets thrown out. (This includes those lunch bag size chips, if it's not in the original large box packing, it's going to get thrown out.)
- Consider getting canned fish or meat other than tuna. There are so many cans of tuna that get donated.
- Consider donating personal hygiene products and feminine hygiene products if your local food bank accepts them.
